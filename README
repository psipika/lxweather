LXWeather - A lightweight GTK+ weather application.

The application uses Yahoo! Weather(r) to retrieve weather forecast and
conditions for specified location(s).

LXWeather uses autotools to generate the executable program and relies on the
following dependencies:
 - glib-2.0-dev[el]
 - gtk+-2.0-dev[el]
 - libxml2-dev[el]

To compile the application manually:
 1) clone this repository:
    git clone git@github.com:psipika/lxweather.git

 2) Execute the following commands:
    cd lxweather  # or whatever the cloned repository directory is
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure   # /usr/local is the default prefix, FYI
    make
    sudo make install # depending on where the application is to be installed
    
Please report all bugs, comments or suggestions directly through the github
issue tracker found at:
   https://github.com/psipika/lxweather/issues


The application GUI supports only one location at a time, but if there is a need
to monitor multiple locations (up to 32), the user can edit LXWeather's
configuration file (${HOME}/.config/lxweather/config), as follows:

## begin snippet ##
[Location 1]
alias=Fiji
country=Fiji
woeid=23424813
units=c
interval=1
enabled=true

[Location 2]
alias=Białystok
city=Białystok
state=podlaskie
country=Poland
woeid=486134
units=c
interval=1
enabled=true
## end snippet ##

Make sure, however, that each location can be identified by a unique number
(e.g.: Location 1, Location 2 . . . Location n).

Have fun!
